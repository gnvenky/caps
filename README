Context-Adaptive Predictive Search (CAPS) Demo
This Google Colab notebook demonstrates a Context-Adaptive Predictive Search (CAPS) engine, which adapts its search result ranking based on user feedback. It showcases how a learning rate (alpha) can influence the adaptiveness of the system.

Contents:
CAPS Class: The original implementation of the search engine with a conservative learning rate (alpha = 0.05).
CAPSV2 Class: A modified version of CAPS with an aggressive learning rate (alpha = 0.5) to show more pronounced adaptation to user feedback.
Demo Usage: Demonstrations of both CAPS and CAPSV2, including initial search results, simulated user feedback, and adapted search results, highlighting the impact of the alpha parameter.
How to Run:
Open the notebook in Google Colab.
Run all cells sequentially. The output will show the initial search results, updated weights after simulated user feedback, and the adapted search results for both CAPS and CAPSV2.
Observe the differences in weight updates and result reordering between CAPS and CAPSV2 to understand the effect of the alpha parameter.
